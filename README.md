<h1> Chord Quiz</h1>
A small Python program that quizzes you on basic chord spellings.
It randomly selects a chord and asks you to type out its notes, then checks your answer and tracks your score.

Features

User input checking

5-question quiz format

Score output at the end

How It Works

When the quiz starts, the program chooses a chord (e.g., C Major) and prompts you:

<code>What are the chords in C Major?</code>


You type the notes separated by spaces, like:

<code>C E G</code>


Your answer is compared against the correct chord tones, and you get immediate feedback.
